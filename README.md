### Project Title : <b><i><u>Electricity Demand Forecasting and Analysis using Time-Series Algorithms</u></i></b>
<br>
India's rapid industrial growth has led to a surge in electricity demand, driven not only by industry but also by other factors. The country's power needs are rising faster than expected, making it one of the top consumers of electricity globally. However, power plants have limited production capacities and cannot quickly increase output or build new facilities to meet these demands. The fluctuating daily energy needs make it difficult for power plants to supply consistent electricity to state governments. Power plants report their production every 15 minutes, allowing the government to request the next day's power. Despite this data, there's no predictive analysis, relying instead on officials' experience, which can be unreliable during sudden demand spikes, risking equipment breakdowns and reduced efficiency. 
<br>

This project aims to create industrially useful results by utilizing a government-regulated dataset on daily energy production and consumption. After filtering and transforming the data, models like [Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning-introduction-to-long-short-term-memory/) and [Short Term Memory (STM - Recurent Neural Network (RNN))](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks-638f64a61ff4) are trained and tested, with predictions de-transformed using inverse functions. Error rates and model fit are assessed before exporting trained models for final output generation. For [Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)](https://medium.com/@ritusantra/introduction-to-arima-model-c8925103f4c7#:~:text=ARIMA%20(Auto%2DRegressive%20Integrated%20Moving,in%20a%20time%20series%20dataset.)), the focus shifts to ensuring stationarity and addressing seasonality before creating and evaluating AR, MA, and ARIMA models. The study aims to optimize power plant efficiency, reduce costs, and mitigate equipment failures amidst rising coal prices and imports.
<br>

The existing system faces several challenges outlined in recent studies. These include limitations in environmental conditions considered, hindering data acquisition for scenarios like climate change. Proposed hybrid methods for energy forecasting encounter complexity issues without comprehensive datasets on various influencing factors. Moreover, the focus on non-renewable energy and lack of integration with sustainable sources further complicate accurate predictions. Issues with computational efficiency arise as methods become more intricate, yet there's uncertainty whether integrating diverse predictive strategies improves accuracy without escalating costs. Industry preferences for daily over monthly predictions add to the complexity, alongside variability in dataset accuracy and the common shortcomings of [Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-neural-networks-and-its-applications/). Additionally, limitations in real-time data analysis and the constraints of platforms like Azure Machine Learning underscore ongoing challenges in developing robust predictive models for energy consumption and production.
<br>

The methodology proposed involves using data from [NRPC](http://nrpc.gov.in/) and [NRLDC](https://wbes.nrldc.in/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f) websites to analyze power consumption and production. Google Colab is chosen for implementation due to its resources. Data preprocessing includes anomaly checks and scaling using [MinMaxScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html). LSTM and RNN models are trained on the data, split into training and testing sets, evaluated using [RMSE](https://c3.ai/glossary/data-science/root-mean-square-error-rmse/) and [R-Sqaured Score](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-r-squared-r2-value-meaning-and-definition/#:~:text=What%20Does%20an%20R%20Squared,the%20dependent%20and%20independent%20variables.), and visualized for deviation. ARIMA model is prepared by converting non-stationary data to stationary using transformations and statistical tests. Models are compared to forecast power generation and determine the best algorithm for industrial decision-making.

While trying to understand the project, you will come across few terms like "<u>Time-Series Data</u>", "<u>Time-Series Forecasting</u>", "<u>Time-Series Analysis</u>", etc. The given <b>[link](https://medium.com/@learn-simplified/time-series-analysis-what-why-and-how-d01a208d2073)</b> will help you out to understand clearly what these terms are. The project documentation also holds the <i><b>"maths and theoretical explanations"</b></i> behind the chosen time-series algorithms. I recommend you to go through them once to grasp the theory behind.
<br>

The project aimed to enhance energy utility efficiency by predicting electricity generation for future time-slabs using time-series analysis. It focused on data from government-regulated websites, utilizing RNN, LSTM, and ARIMA algorithms. ARIMA, despite its requirement for stationary data, showed lower RMSE compared to RNN and LSTM. However, visualization comparisons highlighted ARIMA's higher error rate. LSTM was favored due to addressing vanishing gradient issues. The project's outcomes emphasize choosing appropriate algorithms for specific datasets to optimize electricity generation efficiency and reduce costs associated with equipment failures and errors. Future plans include API implementation for real-time predictions.
